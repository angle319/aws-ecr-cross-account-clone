# ToDo list #

## Repositories to be created at destination with same scan enforce flag as in source ##

Currently, this value is enforced to true. Should match the settings of the repo with the same name in source AWS account.

## Images without tags ##

These should be skipped anyway. Currently, they are added to the clone list but can't be cloned.

## Report which images were synced and which were failed ##

Currently, only numbers are reported
